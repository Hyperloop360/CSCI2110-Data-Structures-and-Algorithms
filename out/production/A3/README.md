## Fifa Stats Demo Program Usage

### How to run the program
In order to run the program the user has to directly interact with the demo class and
insert the desired values to the required parameters. The method descriptions helps 
understand which method does what. Tried to make it as case friendly as possible, so lowercase
of team or parameters should work but wrong spelling will cause error, does not check it. 

### Assumptions 
Used some helper methods to make overall coding easier, for last method assumed most matches to least matches rather
than tournament results.
